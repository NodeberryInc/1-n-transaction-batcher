# 1 - N Transaction Batcher
#### A Part of Nodeberry's Gas Efficient Initiative

Nodeberry is a blockchain research and development company focussed on better solidity products
that can standout in the market. We understand the computation difficulties in ethereum and other EVM compatible chains.



## Features

- Send transactions to N Number of wallets from the contract.
- Contract address and transfer amount are fixed

> This project uses hardhat.

The research was quite useful, We tried it on BSC Smart Chain.

While sending one transaction it costs us 50,000 GAS approx ($ 0.16) but for sending to 10 addresses it costs ($0.46) instead of $ 1.6.

Hell yeah it uses almost 50% less gas.
